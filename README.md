Teaching an algorithm meaning by association.

The basis of inference in accurate association. 

How do we first learn as children?

This algorithm mimics the learning process of young humans, forming a foundation for intelligent and efficient machines that use deductive reasoning to arrive at the expected outcome. 

language::sounds(associated_meaning)

A language is a set of sounds that have associated meaning. We first learn to associate these sounds with objects or actions forming a 

dictionary[:sound] = [thesearus of objects or actions]

in our memory that we make reference, allowing us to effectively communicate with others.

The more a person knows, the better they are at communicating and inferring.
